# StatsPaper

R code supporting a term paper for a module in statistical analysis. 
The data used for analysis was reaction time data from a delay discounting task. 

This repository includes R code for 
* data import: creating some necessary variables, combining experimental with covariate data
* data script: for EDA, analysis and plotting

The model used was a multilevel regression model with binary explanatory factors: Age group was included as a covariate on second level, and immediacy condition (was the early option available immediately or delayed) was included as a factor on first level.
